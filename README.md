To run this test you will need Cypress installed in your computer, how to do that you can find here : https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress
After instaling Cypress you will need to create a new test file in Cypress directory and copy the script to it, to find it more easily you can name it something like : wolt_test.js
You can run the test by using this command in your terminal: npx cypress open That will open the Cypress Test Runner, in here you will see a list of test files, click on the file to run it. The test will then run in a new browser window.
